Memory game is a memory game which can be played by a single player. The goal is to discover all twin cards in as less as possible turns.

***Note: This code will only work on the online compiler `http://www.codeskulptor.org/`, for the reason that the package used in this game 'simplegui' is provided by this compiler which is not openly available for offline use. But it should not be a problem as `Codeskulptor` is very fast, nice and helpful. It has a nice documentation for basic `Pyhton` too.

But still if anyone wants to run this code offline, they can use `simpleguitk` as an alternative for `simplegui`. But then obviously one should replace all `simplegui` in this code by `simpleguitk`. `simpleguitk` is easily available on the web. Just search for it. Optionally you can also watch my video for how to setup `simpleguitk` on your system. The link is: `https://youtu.be/ZMjxtyTdUFM`

Game Controls: Buttons are present on the left hand side of the window. Use them appropriately.
